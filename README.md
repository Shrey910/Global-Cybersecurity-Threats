👉🏻 Donut Chart – Count of Attack Type by Year:

Cyberattacks show consistent high numbers across years, with a peak in:

2022 (319 attacks, 10.63%)

2023 (318 attacks, 10.6%)

2020 (315 attacks, 10.5%)

2024 (310 attacks, 10.33%)

👉🏻 Map Visualization – Country and Number of Affected Users:

Color-coded based on intensity:

Darker shades indicate higher cyber impact.

Key affected regions include North America, Europe, and Asia.

Marker sizes correspond to affected user counts (e.g., 1326, 1174, etc.)

📌 Key Insights:
🔹 Global cyber threats have affected 2 billion users, underlining the critical need for stronger digital infrastructure.

🔹 Despite high defense mechanism counts, top countries like UK, Brazil, and India still experience major breaches, suggesting attackers outpace defenses.

🔹 Total global financial losses amount to over 151 billion USD, a significant economic impact.

🔹 The average incident resolution time is ~36.5 hours, indicating global response efforts are improving but still vary by country.

🔹 Years 2022–2024 saw the highest number of attacks, pointing to increasing digital risk in recent years, potentially due to AI-enabled or remote-work-related vulnerabilities.

🔹 Countries like Germany and Australia bear higher per-incident financial losses, possibly due to higher-value infrastructure targets.
